# Indian Startup Funding Analysis.

Welcome to the Startup Funding Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of startup funding data, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL integration, and interactive visualizations. The goal is to provide insights into the startup ecosystem through various metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs).

---

## Project Overview

This project explores startup funding by:
- **Cleaning and preparing funding data:** The raw data is cleaned and organized for further analysis.
- **Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical analyses help uncover trends and patterns in startup funding.
- **Integrating SQL for data manipulation:** SQL queries are used to extract meaningful information from the dataset.
- **Visualizing insights:** A Power BI dashboard offers an interactive view of funding trends and KPIs.
- **Highlighting key insights and KPIs:** Detailed KPIs and insights are documented to understand the dynamics of the startup funding landscape.

## Repository Structure

- **`cleaned_startup_funding.csv`**  
  Contains the cleaned dataset of startup funding records.

- **`EDA.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter Notebook performing exploratory data analysis. It includes visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover trends in the data.

- **`Funding Analysis.pbix`**  
  Power BI file for interactive visualizations. Use this file to explore funding trends, key metrics, and detailed breakdowns by startup, investor, and funding stages.

- **`sql_Integration.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how SQL queries are integrated into the analysis. It shows how to manipulate and extract data from the funding dataset.

- **`startup_funding_query.sql`**  
  SQL script with queries used to analyze the dataset. This script includes queries to calculate metrics such as total funding, number of deals, and more.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Begin by reviewing the `cleaned_startup_funding.csv` file to understand the dataset. Ensure the data is stored in a directory accessible to your analysis environment.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
   Open the `EDA.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis, generate visualizations, and obtain statistical insights.

3. **SQL Integration:**  
   The `sql_Integration.ipynb` notebook provides a step-by-step guide for data manipulation using SQL. Refer to the `startup_funding_query.sql` script for the queries used in the analysis.

4. **Interactive Visualizations:**  
   Open the `Funding Analysis.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to interact with the visual dashboard. This tool allows you to drill down into specific insights and explore the data dynamically.

5. **Reviewing KPIs & Insights:**  
   The `KPIs & Key Insights.pdf` file outlines the main findings, key metrics, and visualizations. It serves as a summary of the analysis and can be used for presentations or further discussions.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x:**  
  Required to run the Jupyter Notebooks (`EDA.ipynb` and `sql_Integration.ipynb`).

- **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:**  
  For running and exploring the notebooks.

- **Power BI Desktop:**  
  To open and interact with the `Funding Analysis.pbix` file.

- **SQL Environment (Optional):**  
  If you wish to run the SQL scripts independently, ensure you have access to a SQL client or environment that supports SQL queries.
